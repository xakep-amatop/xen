MISRA C rules for Xen
=====================

.. note::

   **IMPORTANT** All MISRA C rules, text, and examples are copyrighted
   by the MISRA Consortium Limited and used with permission.

   Please refer to https://www.misra.org.uk/ to obtain a copy of MISRA
   C, or for licensing options for other use of the rules.

The following is the list of MISRA C rules that apply to the Xen
hypervisor.

It is possible that in specific circumstances it is best not to follow a
rule because it is not possible or because the alternative leads to
better code quality. Those cases are called "deviations". They are
permissible as long as they are documented. For details, please refer to
docs/misra/documenting-violations.rst and docs/misra/deviations.rst

Other documentation mechanisms are work-in-progress.

The existing codebase is not 100% compliant with the rules. Some of the
violations are meant to be documented as deviations, while some others
should be fixed. Both compliance and documenting deviations on the
existing codebase are work-in-progress.

The list below might need to be updated over time. Reach out to THE REST
maintainers if you want to suggest a change.

           assembly code (e.g. 'do_trap_fiq')
         - asm-offsets.c, as they are not linked deliberately, because

     - An identifier declared in an inner scope shall not hide an
       identifier declared in an outer scope

   * - `Rule 5.4 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_05_04.c>`_
     - Required
     - Macro identifiers shall be distinct
     - The Xen characters limit for macro identifiers is 63. Public

   * - `Rule 5.5 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_05_05.c>`_
     - Required
     - Identifiers shall be distinct from macro names
     - Macros expanding to their own name are allowed, e.g.::

           #define x x

       Clashes between names of function-like macros and identifiers of

           void f(int x, int y);

   * - `Rule 5.6 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_05_06.c>`_
     - Required
     - A typedef name shall be a unique identifier
     -

   * - `Rule 6.1 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_06_01.c>`_
     - Required
     - Bit-fields shall only be declared with an appropriate type
     - In addition to the C99 types, we also consider appropriate types
       enum and all explicitly signed / unsigned integer types.

   * - `Rule 6.2 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_06_02.c>`_
     - Required
     - Single-bit named bit fields shall not be of a signed type
     -

   * - `Rule 7.1 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_07_01.c>`_
     - Required
     - Octal constants shall not be used
     -

   * - `Rule 7.2 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_07_02.c>`_
     - Required
     - A "u" or "U" suffix shall be applied to all integer constants
       that are represented in an unsigned type
     - The rule asks that any integer literal that is implicitly
       unsigned is made explicitly unsigned by using one of the
       indicated suffixes.  As an example, on a machine where the int
       type is 32-bit wide, 0x77777777 is signed whereas 0x80000000 is
       (implicitly) unsigned. In order to comply with the rule, the
       latter should be rewritten as either 0x80000000u or 0x80000000U.
       Consistency considerations may suggest using the same suffix even
       when not required by the rule. For instance, if one has:

       Original: f(0x77777777); f(0x80000000);

       one should do

       Solution 1: f(0x77777777U); f(0x80000000U);

       over

       Solution 2: f(0x77777777); f(0x80000000U);

       after having ascertained that "Solution 1" is compatible with the
       intended semantics.

   * - `Rule 7.3 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_07_03.c>`_
     - Required
     - The lowercase character l shall not be used in a literal suffix
     -

   * - `Rule 7.4 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_07_04.c>`_
     - Required
     - A string literal shall not be assigned to an object unless the
       object type is pointer to const-qualified char
     - All "character types" are permitted, as long as the string
       element type and the character type match. (There should be no
       casts.) Assigning a string literal to any object with type
       "pointer to const-qualified void" is allowed.

     - Mandatory
     - The value of an object with automatic storage duration shall not
       be read before it has been set
     - Rule clarification: do not use variables before they are
       initialized. An explicit initializer is not necessarily required.
       Try reducing the scope of the variable. If an explicit
       initializer is added, consider initializing the variable to a
       poison value.

     - Operands shall not be of an inappropriate essential type
     - The following are allowed:

           bitwise or assignment, bitwise xor assignment (bitwise and, or, xor
           are safe on non-negative integers; also Xen assumes two's complement
           representation)
         - Left shift, right shift, left shift assignment, right shift
           assignment (see C-language-toolchain.rst for uses of

           enums (e.g., enum { A, B, C }) to be used as operands to arithmetic
           operators, as they have a signed essential type.

     - Required
     - The value of an expression shall not be assigned to an object
       with a narrower essential type or of a different essential type
       category
     - Please beware that this rule has many violations in the Xen
       codebase today, and its adoption is aspirational. However, when
       submitting new patches please try to decrease the number of
       violations when possible.

       gcc has a helpful warning that can help you spot and remove
       violations of this kind: conversion. For instance, you can use
       it as follows:

       CFLAGS="-Wconversion -Wno-error=sign-conversion -Wno-error=conversion" make -C xen

       instances where Eclair is unable to verify that the code is valid
       in regard to Rule 13.2. Caution reports might not be violations.
       The rule should be followed in any case in new code submitted.

   * - `Rule 13.6 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_13_06.c>`_
     - Required
     - The operand of the sizeof operator shall not contain any
       expression which has potential side effects
     - In addition to sizeof, we also want to apply the rule to typeof
       and alignof

   * - `Rule 14.1 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_14_01.c>`_
     - Required
     - A loop counter shall not have essentially floating type
     -

   * - `Rule 14.3 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_14_03.c>`_
     - Required
     - Controlling expressions shall not be invariant
     - Due to the extensive usage of IS_ENABLED, sizeof compile-time
       checks, and other constructs that are detected as errors by MISRA
       C scanners, managing the configuration of a MISRA C scanner for
       this rule would be unmanageable. Thus, this rule is adopted with
       a project-wide deviation on if, ?:, switch(sizeof(...)), and
       switch(offsetof(...)) statements.

       while(0) and while(1) and alike are allowed.

   * - `Rule 14.4 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_14_04.c>`_
     - Required
     - The controlling expression of an if-statement and the controlling
       expression of an iteration-statement shall have essentially
       Boolean type
     - Automatic conversions of integer types to bool are permitted.
       Automatic conversions of pointer types to bool are permitted.
       This rule still applies to enum types.

   * - `Rule 16.3 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_16_03.c>`_
     - Required
     - An unconditional break statement shall terminate every switch-clause_
     - In addition to break, also other unconditional flow control statements
       such as continue, return, goto are allowed.

   * - `Rule 16.4 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_16_04.c>`_
     - Required
     - Every switch statement shall have a default label
     - Switch statements with enums as controlling expression don't need
       a default label as gcc -Wall enables -Wswitch which warns (and
       breaks the build as we use -Werror) if one of the enum labels is
       missing from the switch.

       Switch statements with integer types as controlling expression
       should have a default label:

       - if the switch is expected to handle all possible cases
         explicitly, then a default label shall be added to handle
         unexpected error conditions, using BUG(), ASSERT(), WARN(),
         domain_crash(), or other appropriate methods;

       - if the switch is expected to handle a subset of all possible
         cases, then an empty default label shall be added with an
         in-code comment on top of the default label with a reason and
         when possible a more detailed explanation. Example::

             default:
                 /* Notifier pattern */
                 break;

   * - `Rule 16.2 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_16_02.c>`_
     - Required
     - A switch label shall only be used when the most closely-enclosing
       compound statement is the body of a switch statement
     - The x86 emulator (xen/arch/x86/x86_emulate*) is exempt from
       compliance with this rule. Efforts to make the x86 emulator
       adhere to Rule 16.2 would result in increased complexity and
       maintenance difficulty, and could potentially introduce bugs. 

   * - `Rule 16.6 <https://gitlab.com/MISRA/MISRA-C/MISRA-C-2012/Example-Suite/-/blob/master/R_16_06.c>`_
     - Required

     - #define and #undef shall not be used on a reserved identifier or
       reserved macro name
     - Identifiers starting with an underscore followed by another underscore
       or an upper-case letter are reserved. Today Xen uses many, such as
       header guards and bitwise manipulation functions. Upon analysis it turns
       out Xen identifiers do not clash with the identifiers used by modern
       GCC, but that is not a guarantee that there won't be a naming clash in
       the future or with another compiler.  For these reasons we discourage
       the introduction of new reserved identifiers in Xen, and we see it as
       positive the reduction of reserved identifiers. At the same time,
       certain identifiers starting with two underscores are also commonly used
       in Linux (e.g. __set_bit) and we don't think it would be an improvement
       to rename them.
