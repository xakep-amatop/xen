/*
 * Data in or about the low memory trampoline.
 *
 * x86 systems software typically needs a block of logic below the 1M
 * boundary, commonly called the trampoline, containing 16-bit logic.  Xen has
 * a combined trampoline of all necessary 16-bit logic, formed of two parts.
 *
 * 1) The permanent trampoline; a single 4k page containing:
 *
 *    - The INIT-SIPI-SIPI entrypoint for APs, and
 *    - The S3 wakeup vector.
 *
 *    Both of these are 16-bit entrypoints, responsible for activating paging
 *    and getting into 64-bit mode.  This requires the permanent trampoline to
 *    be identity mapped in idle_pg_table[].
 *
 *    The SIPI64 spec deprecates the 16-bit AP entrypoint, while S0ix (also
 *    called Low Power Idle or Connected Standby) deprecates S3.
 *
 * 2) The boot trampoline:
 *
 *    This is used by the BSP to drop into 16-bit mode, make various BIOS
 *    calls to obtain E820/EDID/etc.  It follows the permanent and exceeds 4k,
 *    but is only used in 16-bit and 32-bit unpaged mode so does not need
 *    mapping in pagetables.
 *
 *    When the BIOS calls are complete, execution does join back with the AP
 *    path, and becomes subject to the same paging requirements.  This path is
 *    not needed for non-BIOS boots.
 *
 * The location of trampoline is not fixed.  The layout of low memory varies
 * greatly from platform to platform.  Therefore, the trampoline is relocated
 * manually as part of placement.
 */

/*
 * Layout of the trampoline.  Logical areas, in ascending order:
 *
 * 1) AP boot:
 *
 *    The INIT-SIPI-SIPI entrypoint.  This logic is stack-less so the identity
 *    mapping (which must be executable) can at least be Read Only.
 *
 * 2) S3 resume:
 *
 *    The S3 wakeup logic may need to interact with the BIOS, so needs a
 *    stack.  The stack pointer is set to trampoline_phys + 4k and clobbers an
 *    arbitrary part of the the boot trampoline.  The stack is only used with
 *    paging disabled.
 *
 * 3) Boot trampoline:
 *
 *    The boot trampoline collects data from the BIOS (E820/EDD/EDID/etc), so
 *    needs a stack.  The stack pointer is set to trampoline_phys + 64k, is 4k
 *    in size, and only used with paging disabled.
 *
 * 4) Heap space:
 *
 *    The first 1k of heap space is statically allocated scratch space for
 *    VESA information.
 *
 *    The remainder of the heap is used by reloc(), logic which is otherwise
 *    outside of the trampoline, to collect the bootloader metadata (cmdline,
 *    module list, etc).  It does so with a bump allocator starting from the
 *    end of the heap and allocating backwards.
 *
 * 5) Boot stack:
 *
 *    The boot stack is 4k in size at the end of the trampoline, taking the
 *    total trampoline size to 64k.
 *
 * Therefore, when placed, it looks somewhat like this:
 *
 *    +--- trampoline_phys
 *    v
 *    |<-------------------------------64K------------------------------->|
 *    |<-----4K----->|                                         |<---4K--->|
 *    +-------+------+-+---------------------------------------+----------+
 *    | AP+S3 |  Boot  | Heap                                  |    Stack |

 *    |       |      | +- trampoline_end[]                     |          |
 *    |       |      +--- wakeup_stack      reloc() allocator -+          |
 *    |       +---------- trampoline_perm_end      Boot Stack ------------+
 *    +------------------ trampoline_start[]
 *
 * Note: trampoline_start[] and trampoline_end[] represent the shown
 * boundaries, but are addresses as linked into Xen's .init section.
